# Prototype to Showcase AI Solution (Mission 2)

*Similar Cars Finder*  is an application designed to showcase the power of AI technology in recognizing and recommending similar motor vehicles based on their visual characteristics. By leveraging a cloud-based AI service on Microsoft Azure, this app allows users to upload the URL of a car picture and instantly find a matching vehicle from the available stock, enabling efficient comparison and recommendation for customers.

This project was developed as part of Full-Stack Development studies, serving as a practical implementation to explore and apply various concepts and technologies. The primary focus of this project was on the backend functionality, and the user interface and user experience were not prioritized.

# Technologies Used
* JavaScript: The application is built using JavaScript for the frontend logic and interaction.
* CustomVision.ai: The AI service provided by Microsoft Azure is utilized to train and deploy a custom model capable of recognizing motor vehicles based on their type, color, and make.
